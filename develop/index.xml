      <description>Prerequisites Clone the PatternFly Elements repo and run the install command from the root of the repository.
npm install  Generating a PatternFly Element The easiest way to build a new component from scratch is to use the generator. The generator will ask you a few questions that will help with the scaffolding. Make sure you are in the root directory of the PatternFly Elements repository.
npm run new  When creating your new components, you may find you are entering the same answers over and over again.</description>

      <description>Prerequisites Before you begin, make sure you&amp;rsquo;ve followed the Prerequisites in Getting Started.
The PatternFly Element Generator Use the PatternFly Element generator to start the scaffolding process. From the root directory of the PatternFly Elements repository, run the following command.
npm run new  The generator will ask you a series of questions to set up your project.
 Your element name:
 Your element&amp;rsquo;s name should be lowercase and needs to contain at least one hyphen.</description>

 We always add custom events if there are interactive. We use custom events to convey state changes We always making event names lowercase. This is the style most DOM events already use: mousedown, popstate, beforeunload, etc.  Using web components within a framework

      <description>Light DOM vs. Shadow DOM The concept of light DOM is already familiar to any web developer. Basic HTML elements that you place into a .html file are light DOM. Tags like &amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;, &amp;lt;div&amp;gt; and &amp;lt;aside&amp;gt; are all simple light DOM.
However, when you add a tag to the light DOM such as select, the browser has additional styles that are invoked from within the Shadow DOM.
When building web components, you may choose whether to keep content in the light DOM (i.</description>

      <description>Run this command from the project root to start the build, watch, and server processes, see others in the project README.
npm run live-demo [component-name(s)]  The server will load on http://localhost:8000 by default.
Navigate to http://localhost:8000/elements/pfe-cool-element/demo/ to view your element.
You&amp;rsquo;re off to a good start! You have a new custom element that extends the base PFElement class, uses shadow DOM, and has a built-in fallback for ShadyCSS in case shadow DOM isn&amp;rsquo;t supported.</description>

      <title>Write your HTML</title>

      <description>Now that our element is set up and our dev server is running, let&amp;rsquo;s take advantage of the slot and shadow root to make our element a bit more interesting.
We&amp;rsquo;ll edit the /src/pfe-cool-element.html file to add some additional HTML. Let&amp;rsquo;s turn pfe-cool-element into a profile element that has a profile photo, a username, and a button to follow the user.
Here&amp;rsquo;s the updated HTML in /src/pfe-cool-element.html:
&amp;lt;div class=&amp;quot;pfe-cool-element__profile&amp;quot; id=&amp;quot;profile-pic&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt; &amp;lt;slot&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/slot&amp;gt; &amp;lt;div class=&amp;quot;pfe-cool-element__social&amp;quot;&amp;gt; &amp;lt;button class=&amp;quot;pfe-cool-element__social--follow&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Follow&amp;lt;/button&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;  We&amp;rsquo;ll also need to update /demo/index.</description>

      <title>Write your CSS (or Sass)</title>

      <description>We want the pfe-cool-element to have a profile photo, a username, and a follow button. Right now, it only contains the HTML structure, but we can style our element by updating our Sass (or CSS) to make it look the way we want.
We&amp;rsquo;ll be working in the /src/pfe-cool-element.scss file since we decided to use the Sass option in the PatternFly Element generator.
Your Sass file will initially import additional Sass from the pfe-sass node module, but we can ignore that for now.</description>

      <description>In this step, we will:
 Add a click and keyup listener to the follow button Set a follow state on element Add a the profile photo Properly disconnect our element  First, we&amp;rsquo;ll go ahead and listen for triggering events on the button. The best place to add a listener is in the constructor, according to the W3C Custom Elements draft section called &amp;ldquo;2.2 Requirements for custom element constructors&amp;rdquo;:</description>

      <title>Define your schema</title>

      <description>What is a schema?
A schema can teach a system like a CMS or API how to understand our web component. By defining the supported slots, attributes, and events in our schema, we make our web components easy to plug into a number of systems. We also create a system by which we can easily update the defaults and acceptable values for our component without having to make changes to JavaScript.</description>

      <description>Let&amp;rsquo;s write a test for the pfe-cool-element.
We rely on a few tools to ensure our element is reliable in production:
 Web Component Tester, built and maintained by the Polymer team, makes testing easy. All we have to do is add the element&amp;rsquo;s HTML to a file and set up our suite of tests. We&amp;rsquo;ll use the Chai Assertion Library to make sure our tests pass since Mocha and Chai are both included in Web Component Tester.</description>
